- 👋 Hi, I’m @naoual-work
- 👀 I’m interested in creating beautiful, user-friendly web interfaces and exploring the latest front-end technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced React.js, TypeScript, and optimizing web performance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Front-end projects, UI/UX improvements, or anything JavaScript-related.
- ⚡ Fun fact; I can spend hours perfecting a single button's hover animation—and love every second of it!
